## Github App Configuration

Once you have created your own GitHub App, you need to configure it for MatterAI.

Below are the configuration values needed:

- App Name
- App ID
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Private Key (base64 encoded)
- Webhook Secret

<Warning>Remember to Base64 encode the `private-key.pem`, you can run `base64 -i private-key.pem` and enter the output in the Private Key input box under github app config</Warning>

### **Enable PR Review Comments** 
When enabled, MatterAI will post detailed review comments on pull requests, highlighting potential issues and suggestions directly in the code diff.

#### Enable PR Review on Commits
When enabled, MatterAI will automatically review new commits pushed to pull requests, providing feedback on the latest changes.

#### Enable Language Rulesets in Review
When enabled, MatterAI will apply language-specific rules and best practices during code reviews, ensuring code quality and consistency.

#### Enable Similarity Search
When enabled, MatterAI will search for similar code patterns across your codebase to identify potential duplications or reusable components.

#### Enable Lite Review
When enabled, performs a faster, less resource-intensive review that focuses on critical issues only.

### **Enable PR Description Generation**

#### Enable PR Description as Comment
When enabled, the generated PR description will be posted as a comment instead of updating the PR description directly.

#### Enable Quality Recommendations in Summary
When enabled, includes code quality improvement recommendations in the review summary.

#### Enable Sequence Diagram in Summary
When enabled, generates and includes sequence diagrams in the review summary to help visualize complex interactions in the code.

## Disabled Repositories
