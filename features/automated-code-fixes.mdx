<Note>
Automated Code Fixes is available on all plans.
</Note>

This guide walks you through the automated code fix capabilities of MatterAI, which eliminates manual copy-pasting by automatically generating fix PRs for review comments.

## What are Automated Code Fixes?

The `/matter fix` command automatically generates a fix PR that addresses all review comments from Matter AI. No manual copy-pasting needed - the AI analyzes your code and creates precise fixes in a separate branch for safe review.

## How It Works

### 1. Fetch Review Comments
- Retrieves all Matter AI review comments from the current PR
- Analyzes the context and suggestions provided
- Identifies actionable fixes that can be automated

### 2. Generate Precise Fixes
- Analyzes the codebase to understand the current implementation
- Generates exact code changes based on review suggestions
- Ensures fixes align with your project's coding standards
- Maintains code functionality while applying improvements

### 3. Create Fix Branch
- Creates a new branch specifically for the automated fixes
- Applies all generated fixes to the new branch
- Ensures no direct commits to your original branch

### 4. Open Fix PR
- Opens a new Pull Request targeting your original branch
- Includes detailed description of all fixes applied
- Provides clear commit history for easy review

## Benefits

### Time Savings
- **15-30 minutes saved per PR**: No more manual copy-pasting of suggestions
- **Instant application**: Fixes are applied immediately after generation
- **Batch processing**: Handles multiple review comments simultaneously

### Accuracy Improvements
- **Eliminates manual errors**: No risk of typos or incorrect applications
- **Consistent application**: All fixes follow the same standards
- **Context-aware**: Understands your specific codebase structure

### Safety Features
- **Separate branch creation**: Original PR remains untouched
- **Reviewable changes**: All fixes can be reviewed before merging
- **GitHub integration**: Works seamlessly with your existing workflow

## How to Use

1. **Get Matter AI reviews**: First, use any Matter AI review command (`/matter review`, `/matter review-max`, `/matter review-full`)
2. **Trigger automated fixes**: Comment on the PR with `/matter fix` or `@matterai fix`
3. **Review the fix PR**: Examine the automatically generated Pull Request
4. **Merge when ready**: Merge the fix PR once you're satisfied with the changes

## Supported Review Types

Automated fixes work with all Matter AI review commands:

- **`/matter review`**: Basic code review suggestions
- **`/matter review-max`**: Advanced AI analysis with tool-use
- **`/matter review-full`**: Complete PR analysis
- **Any combination**: Mix and match review types before using fixes

## What Gets Fixed

The automated system can handle various types of code improvements:

### Code Quality Issues
- Formatting and style improvements
- Naming convention corrections
- Code structure optimizations

### Performance Optimizations
- Inefficient loop improvements
- Memory usage optimizations
- Algorithm enhancements

### Security Improvements
- Input validation additions
- Security best practice implementations
- Vulnerability patches

### Bug Fixes
- Logic error corrections
- Edge case handling
- Exception management improvements

## Safety & Security

### Branch Isolation
- **Separate branch**: Fixes are applied to a new branch, not your working branch
- **No force pushes**: Your original commits remain unchanged
- **Clean history**: Fixes are organized in logical commits

### Review Process
- **All changes reviewable**: Every fix can be examined before merging
- **Detailed descriptions**: Each fix includes explanation of what was changed
- **Rollback capability**: Easy to revert if needed

### Code Privacy
- **Repository stays private**: No code leaves your GitHub repository
- **Secure processing**: All analysis happens within GitHub's secure environment
- **Access control**: Respects your repository's permission settings

## Best Practices

### Before Using Automated Fixes
1. **Review all comments**: Read through all Matter AI review comments first
2. **Understand the changes**: Make sure you agree with the suggested improvements
3. **Check confidence scores**: Focus on high-confidence fixes first

### After Fix Generation
1. **Review the PR carefully**: Examine all changes in the generated PR
2. **Run tests**: Ensure all automated fixes pass your test suite
3. **Verify functionality**: Confirm the fixes don't break existing features

### When NOT to Use
- **Complex architectural changes**: Manual review needed for major structural changes
- **Business logic modifications**: Human review required for logic changes
- **Experimental features**: When you're unsure about the proposed improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No review comments found**: Ensure you've run a Matter AI review command first
- **Fixes not applicable**: Some suggestions may require manual intervention
- **Merge conflicts**: The fix PR may have conflicts with recent changes

### Getting Help
- **Ask for clarification**: Use `/matter <question>` to ask about specific fixes
- **Request manual review**: For complex changes, ask for human review
- **Provide context**: Include relevant information about your specific use case

## Integration with Development Workflow

Automated fixes integrate seamlessly with standard development practices:

- **CI/CD integration**: Fix PRs can trigger your normal CI pipeline
- **Code review process**: Treat fix PRs like any other code review
- **Team collaboration**: Team members can review and approve automated fixes
- **Documentation updates**: Include documentation changes in the automated process
