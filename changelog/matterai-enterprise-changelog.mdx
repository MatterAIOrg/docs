- **`grep_search` Tool**: AI can search for patterns across the codebase using grep, enabling comprehensive code analysis
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Advanced reviews work with both **Google Gemini** and **Anthropic Claude** providers
- **Configurable Iterations**: Control how many tool calls the AI can make during analysis

**Benefits:**
- Deeper, more contextual code reviews
- AI understands how changes affect other parts of your codebase
- Catches cross-file issues and dependency problems
