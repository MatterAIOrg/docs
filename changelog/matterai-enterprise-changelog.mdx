## 🚀 Major Features

### Advanced Code Review with Agentic Tool Calling

Introducing a revolutionary upgrade to the code review experience. Matter AI can now actively explore your codebase during reviews using intelligent tool calling.

**What's New:**
- **Repository Cloning & Exploration**: The AI now clones your repository and generates a directory listing to understand the full codebase structure
- **`read_file` Tool**: AI can read files with line ranges to understand context, verify imports, and trace function calls
- **`grep_search` Tool**: AI can search for patterns across the codebase using grep, enabling comprehensive code analysis
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Advanced reviews work with both **Google Gemini** and **Anthropic Claude** providers
- **Configurable Iterations**: Control how many tool calls the AI can make during analysis

**Benefits:**
- Deeper, more contextual code reviews
- AI understands how changes affect other parts of your codebase
- Catches cross-file issues and dependency problems

### `/matter fix` Command

Automatically generate code fixes from review comments with a single command.

**Usage:**
```bash
/matter fix
```

**How It Works:**
1. Collects all unresolved review comments on the PR
2. Reads the current file contents for affected files
3. Uses AI to generate targeted code fixes
4. Creates a new PR with the fix branch automatically

**Supported Models:**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (preferred)
- Gemini 3 Pro Preview
- Axon Code (MatterAI)

### Repository Memory Integration

Leverage stored repository knowledge for context-aware code reviews.

**Features:**
- **File-Based Memory Matching**: Memories are matched based on files changed in the PR
- **Usage Tracking**: Automatically tracks which memories are used and how often
- **PR Summary Display**: Shows which repository memories influenced the review
- **Prompt Injection**: Relevant memories are injected into AI prompts for contextual reviews

**Memory Analytics:**
- `usage_count`: Track how often each memory is used
- `last_used_at`: See when memories were last referenced

**PR Summary Example:**
```markdown
### 📚 Repository Memories Used

**1. Authentication Guidelines**
   - *Tags:* security, auth
   - *Files:* src/auth/*.ts
   - *Content:* Always validate JWT tokens...
```

## ✨ New Console Features

### LLM Logs Enhanced Filtering

The LLM Logs dashboard now includes comprehensive filtering capabilities for better observability:

- **Repository Filter** — Filter logs by specific repositories or by MCP Server requests
- **Provider Filter** — Filter by LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google/Vertex, MatterAI)
- **Model Filter** — Filter logs by specific AI models
- **Prompt ID Filter** — Filter by prompt identifiers for tracing specific request types

All filters work together to provide granular insights into your LLM usage patterns and costs.
