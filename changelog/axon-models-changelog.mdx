## Web Search & Web Fetch Tool Calling
MatterAI Axon now supports web search and web fetch tool calling to provide a high level overview of the reasoning process. This allows you to balance between accuracy and performance.

- `web_search` - LLM will use web search to find relevant information
- `web_fetch` - LLM will scrape the provided URL to find relevant information

<Note>
Tool Calling is always available and enabled by default.
</Note>
</Update>

<Update label="August 10th, 2025">
## Reasoning Summary in Response
MatterAI Axon now supports reasoning summary in response to provide a high level overview of the reasoning process. This allows you to balance between accuracy and performance.

- `auto` - AI will decide whether to provide a summary or not
- `none` - AI will never provide a summary

```json
{
  "reasoning": {
    "summary": "auto"
  }
}
```

<Note>
Reasoning summary is always enclosed in a `<reasoning_start>` REASONING `<reasoning_end>` tag.
</Note>
</Update>

## Reasoning Effort Options
MatterAI Axon now supports reasoning effort options to control the level of reasoning and analysis performed by the AI model. This allows you to balance between accuracy and performance.

- `None` - No reasoning, fastest
- `Low` - Fastest, least accurate
- `Medium` - Good balance
- `High` - Most accurate, slowest

```json
{
  "reasoning": {
    "effort": "low | medium | high | none"
  }
}
```
