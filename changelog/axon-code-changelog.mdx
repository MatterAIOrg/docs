- **Improved Batch File Permission UI:** Updated the UI for batch file permissions, including better display of file paths and line snippets.
- **Redesigned Accept/Reject Buttons:** Overhauled the UI for accepting/rejecting file changes, featuring an expandable list of affected files with individual diff statistics and a consolidated action footer.
- **General UI/Styling Refinements:** Applied various styling and layout improvements across `ToolUseBlock`, `ToolUseBlockHeader`, `ModelSelector`, and `CodeAccordian` components for a cleaner user experience.

### Fixed
